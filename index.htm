    <b>DESCRIPTION</b>: stand-alone Senior High School (SHS) is a secondary school that operates independently from a Junior High School (JHS) or Integrated School (IS). It has its own distinct location and a separate school head (principal). This contrasts with Integrated SHS, which is located within an existing JHS or IS and shares the same school head. </font>      <hr color="red" size="5" width="250">
